# Analysis for ramses-ism disc formation simulations
This package provides a thin layer over the osyris package to grab data from the osyris dicts into structured arrays on a static regular mesh by upscaling. The library also provides useful functions to analyse discs produced in AMR collapse simulations: computing Toomre Q, eccentricity, fluxes etc.

## Installing the package
This library is packaged as a pyproject so installation only requires running ``` python3 -m pip install . ``` from the project root directory.

## Examples
Example notebooks can be found in the ``` ./notebooks ``` directory

## Tesselation
This is a work in progress and work will be slow. hopefully one day it will be complete, working, and integrated with a python layer.
